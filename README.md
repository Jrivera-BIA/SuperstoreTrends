## 📁 Project Overview

- **Tools:** Tableau, Excel/Google Sheets (and SQL if applicable)
- **Data:** Superstore orders & returns (orders, customers, products, regions)
- **Focus:** Sales performance, returns, and business recommendations

---

## 🔍 Key Questions

1. Which product categories and subcategories generate the most revenue?
2. Which items and segments have the highest **return rate**?
3. Are certain **regions or customer segments** more likely to return products?
4. How do returns affect **overall profitability**?

---

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned order and return data (removed duplicates, standardized IDs)
   - Joined orders with returns to flag returned orders
2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Calculated return rate by product category, region, and customer segment
   - Looked at seasonality/holiday periods vs. returns
3. **Dashboard Design (Tableau)**
   - Overview page: sales, profit, and return KPIs
   - Drilldowns by category, region, and customer segment
   - Interactive filters for date range and customer segment
4. **Insights**
   - Highlighted top products driving a large share of returns
   - Flagged regions/segments with above-average return rates
   - Suggested actions (quality review, policy changes, or expectation-setting)
